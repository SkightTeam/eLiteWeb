eLiteWeb
========
eLiteWeb is a extreme lightweight web "framework".
Apply DDD concept and leverage DI, FrontController patterns to maximize performance and productivity.

Actually, it is not a real framework, at least I am not going to publish it as a framework. It is more like an architect design example. As I annouced years ago: " (General) Framework is dead!"
