eLiteWeb
========
#General Application Framework is dead!
Actually it is all developers' dream including myself. 
But eventually I figure out it is not possible, at least, it is not the proper way to 
compose a General Application Framework at first place.
A example is [CSLA](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/) which IS nice one, and I learned from it lots. But it
is not perfect for me to create my own project base on it. 
[DotNetNuke](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/) is another success project for sure. But first, it is not framework
, it is more Application Platform or just an application, a CMS application.

OK, so why I still state 'eLiteWeb is a extreme lightweight web "framework".' 
* It is "private" framework, your every project can have one, don't have to maintain a "consistent" framework 
cross your company.
* Acutally it is more domonstration of framework, you can customize it to fit your need. The purpose of open source, right?
Apply DDD concept and leverage DI, FrontController patterns to maximize performance and productivity.

As a domonstration, when we are learning, we are wondering what is [Repository](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) 
look [like]()
Actually, it is not a real framework, at least I am not going to publish it as a framework. It is more like an architect design example. As I annouced years ago: " (General) Framework is dead!"
