eLiteWeb
========
*General Application Framework is dead!* Actually it is all developers' dream including myself. 
But eventually I figure out it is not possible, at least, it is not the proper to 
compose a General Application Framework at first place.
A example is [CSLA](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/) which IS nice one, and I learned from it lots. But it
is not perfect for my own project. 
[DotNetNuke](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/) is another success project for sure. But first, it is not framework
, it is more Application Platform or just an application, a CMS application.

OK, so why I still state 'eLiteWeb is a extreme lightweight web "framework".' 
Apply DDD concept and leverage DI, FrontController patterns to maximize performance and productivity.

Actually, it is not a real framework, at least I am not going to publish it as a framework. It is more like an architect design example. As I annouced years ago: " (General) Framework is dead!"
